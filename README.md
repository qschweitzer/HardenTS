# Just a word...
Welcome to our GitHub Repo dedicated to enhance the security and stability of Remote Desktop Servers. We both believe in a world were knowledge have to be shared, especialy when we are talking of protecting companies against cyber attacks. Our IT journey drove us to many situation in which we had to harden an existing RDS farm, most oftenly lacking of a security posture due to a lack of technical knowledge or usefull guidance.

This project is intended to assist you in setting-up a hardened RDS farm, based on our experiences and a lot of KB already tested.
